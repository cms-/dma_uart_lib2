# dma_uart_lib2
A modular single producer / consumer serial stream library providing buffered access to serial peripherals.

This is largely a work in progress as I build up my embedded C skills. Roadmap is essentially a buffering framework that allows sustained streams of data produced and consumed at a predictable rate. Provides flags for building a thread scheduling.

May be incomplete or broken at this time.
